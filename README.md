# Bitcoin Wallet Encryption with HTML



### Coffee Tips--> BTC: 1P6gz8bggna5s93th9CxNommxcNivN2bPp 


This project provides a simple HTML-based tool for encrypting and decrypting Bitcoin wallet files. The encryption is done using the WebCrypto API, allowing users to secure their wallet data with a password.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt Bitcoin wallet files using AES-GCM encryption. Encrypt Bitcoin Wallet with HTML can encrypt your Wallet or SEED in various file types, including plain text files (.txt), documents (Word, PDF, Excel, etc.), images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.), archives (ZIP, TAR, RAR, etc.
- **Password Protection**: Secure the encrypted file with a user-provided password.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt the encrypted wallet file using the same password.
- **Uses SHA-256 same Algo that secures Bitcoin**: In this code, SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is employed as a critical component of the password-based key derivation process. When a user enters a password, it is converted into a fixed-size hash using SHA-256. This hash then serves as the basis for key generation through the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm. The strength of SHA-256 lies in its cryptographic properties, including resistance to collisions and its one-way nature, making it computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original password. By utilizing SHA-256 in the key derivation process, the code enhances the security of the encryption mechanism, as it ensures that the resulting cryptographic key is derived from a securely hashed version of the user's password, adding an extra layer of protection to the Bitcoin wallet encryption process.
- **Things that can go wrong**:     Brute Force Attacks: Attackers could attempt to guess the strong password through brute force attacks. Although a strong password reduces the likelihood of success, brute force attacks can still be attempted, especially if the password has a vulnerability.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èPassword Sniffing: If the password is transmitted over an insecure channel, such as an unsecured Wi-Fi network, it could be intercepted using packet sniffing techniques.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èCode Modification: The HTML and JavaScript code stored on a server or in public storage might be susceptible to tampering. If an attacker gains access to the code, they could modify it to capture passwords or leak sensitive information.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èSocial Engineering: Even with a strong password, users might still be susceptible to social engineering attacks, where attackers manipulate individuals into revealing their passwords or sensitive information.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èServer Compromise: If the server hosting the HTML and JavaScript code is compromised, attackers could gain access to the stored strong passwords or modify the code for malicious purposes.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èLack of Secure Communication: If the communication between the user and the server is not secure (e.g., using HTTPS), attackers might intercept and manipulate the data, compromising the security of the password.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èKey Management Issues: If the system lacks proper key management practices, such as secure generation and storage of cryptographic keys, it could introduce vulnerabilities even if the password is strong.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èCryptographic Weaknesses: While the provided code uses AES-GCM, the implementation might have vulnerabilities, and the lack of security audits increases the risk of potential weaknesses.

    ‚ö†Ô∏èZero-Day Exploits: If there are unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in the encryption or decryption logic, attackers could exploit them without the knowledge of the system owner..

## How to Use

### Encryption

1. Select a wallet file (.txt) using the provided file input.
2. Enter a password and repeat it for confirmation.
3. Click "Encrypt file" to generate an encrypted HTML file.

### Decryption

1. Open the generated encrypted HTML file.
2. Enter the password used for encryption.
3. Click "Decrypt file" to retrieve the original wallet file.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with support for the WebCrypto API.
